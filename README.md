# AIS AIVDM/AIVDO Parser for .NET #

An NMEA AIS [AIVDM/AIVDO](http://catb.org/gpsd/AIVDM.html) parser for .NET Core. Written in F# using FParsec. The advantage of using a parser combinator library is that the implementation looks very similar to the specification. Thus the code is clean and  easyer to validate against the specification.

Currently parses:

* Types 1, 2 and 3: Position Report Class A
* Type 4: Base Station Report
* Type 5: Static and Voyage Related Data

Have fun!
